# PacMen
Description: A PacMen game. 
When the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen.
When the "Start Game" button is clicked, the pacman or pacmen created start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes position to stay within the frame of the web page.

How to Run: Download or clone files to local device. Run index.html file on any browser.

Roadmap of future improvements: Would be fun to add more types of charactors to the game, like PacMan's enemies.
